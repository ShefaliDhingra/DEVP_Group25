# Trade Analysis Project

## Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing international trade patterns by examining imports and exports across various countries, products, and time periods. By leveraging a dataset containing transaction-level details, the analysis aims to uncover trade flow dynamics, highlight seasonal or regional variations, and identify the most frequently traded goods, offering insights into global trade behaviors.

## Objectives
- Identify key trends in import and export volumes over time.
- Analyze trade flows between countries and regions.
- Examine the most frequently traded products and categories.
- Highlight seasonal or time-based trends in global trade.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this analysis contains the following key features:
- **Transaction ID**: Unique identifier for each trade transaction.
- **Country**: The country involved in the trade.
- **Product**: Description of the product being traded.
- **Import/Export**: Indicator of whether the transaction is an import or export.
- **Quantity**: Quantity of goods traded.
- **Value**: Monetary value of the transaction.
- **Date**: Date of the transaction.
- **Category**: Product category.
- **Port**, **Customs Code**, **Weight**, **Shipping Method**: Additional trade and logistical details.

## Analysis Approach
1. **Data Cleaning**: Remove duplicates, handle missing data, and ensure consistency in the dataset.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualize trade trends, country-level trade volumes, and product-level patterns.
3. **Trade Flow Analysis**: Analyze imports and exports by country, product, and time period.
4. **Trend Analysis**: Identify seasonal and regional trends in trade patterns.
5. **Insights and Recommendations**: Provide actionable insights for stakeholders based on the analysis results.

    "## 6. Observations\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **From Non-Categorical Variables, we observed the following:**\n",
    "    - Symmetry: Both Quantity and Value show a relatively symmetric distribution, with their mean and median being close.\n",
    "    - Variability: There is considerable variability in all three variables, as indicated by the standard deviations and the range between minimum and maximum values.\n",
    "    - Skewness: Although not directly visible, given that the minimum values are much lower and the maximum values are quite high, these variables could be slightly positively skewed, with a few higher values pulling the mean above the median.\n",
    "    - Mode values are lower than the mean and median for Value and Weight, which could indicate some common small transactions.\n",
    "    - Range values confirm that the data has a very wide spread, indicating diverse transaction sizes.\n",
    "    - Symmetry: All three variables have very low skewness, indicating their distributions are quite symmetric.\n",
    "    - Flat Distributions: The negative kurtosis values for all three variables suggest that the distributions are flatter than normal, with fewer outliers.\n",
    "    - Moderate Relative Variability: All Non-Categorical variables exhibit a moderate degree of relative variability, with CV values **above 55%**. This indicates that while there is variation in the data, it’s not extreme.\n",
    "    - Confidence in the Mean: The narrow confidence intervals suggest that, despite the variability, the estimates for the mean of each variable are fairly precise.\n",
    "    - Weight's Higher Variability: While the confidence interval for weight is wider than those for quantity and value, the overall variability in weight reflects that the traded goods may have a more diverse range of weights compared to their quantities or values.\n",
    "    - The variables are largely independent, with no evidence of strong direct causal relationships based on the correlation matrix.\n",
    "    \n",
    "2. **For Categorical Variables, the observations were as follows:**\n",
    "    - Frequency: The dataset is perfectly sampled with a 0.51:0.49 ratio of Import_Export values.\n",
    "    - The no. of Imports in the sample is more than no. of Exports, but sice their frquencies are comparable, they dont have much difference between no. of values\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Trade Trend Analysis observations:**\n",
    "    - Top Exporting Countries: India, Congo, and Maldives are among the countries exporting the highest value of goods.\n",
    "    - Top Exported Products: Onto, Now, and Mr are the top exported products. Although Onto generates the most wealth for its suppliers, Now is not among the top 10 wealth-generating products for the country, and Mr is ranked 8th.\n",
    "    - Top Imported Products: Explain, Strong, and Focus were the top imported products.\n",
    "    - 2021 was the year with the maximum imported products, and 2019 had the minimum exported products. One probable cause could be COVID-19.\n",
    "    - August 2018 was the month with the highest volume of imports.\n",
    "    - Highest Valued Goods Imported in Countries: Bahrain, Brazil, and Belarus.\n",
    "    - Highest Valued Goods Exported from Countries: India, Congo, and Maldives.\n",
    "    - Top Suppliers: Wright Group and Brown PLC are the leading suppliers, contributing the most in terms of total value of exported goods.\n",
    "    - Trade Balance: A positive trade balance was observed for countries that export more than they import, and vice versa for countries with a negative trade balance. Bahrain has the largest trade balance gap, indicating a focus on exports.\n",
    "    - Average Trade Value per Transaction was **$5057.81**.\n",
    "    - Maximum Average value per product is for the product **need**\n",
    "    - Preferred Payment Terms: Cash on Delivery is the most preferred payment term in Bahrain, while countries like India favor Net 30 terms.\n",
    "    - Time Between Orders: The average time between orders is approximately 1.85 days for exports and 1.80 days for imports, indicating similar purchasing patterns.\n",

    "**1. Trade Flow and Market Opportunities**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Balanced Trade Flow: With an almost equal split between imports and exports (51:49), the trade environment for the analyzed markets is balanced. This stability suggests that both importing and exporting operations are equally viable areas of focus, depending on the country or product.\n",
    "- Opportunities in Export Markets: Countries such as India, Congo, and Maldives are identified as top exporters of goods. **Companies looking to enter or expand in these markets should align their offerings to these countries’ key export demands.** Moreover, the export of products like **Onto**, which generates significant wealth, **presents a lucrative opportunity for suppliers in these markets**.\n",

    "**2. Product-Level Insights for Strategic Positioning**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Top Exported Products: **Onto, Now, and Mr** are key exported products, but there are notable differences in their economic contributions. While Onto leads in wealth generation, Now does not feature in the top wealth-generating products despite being a top export. This suggests a **mismatch between product volume and value, signaling that suppliers may need to reassess their pricing strategies or focus on higher-value exports.**\n",
    "- Product Wealth Potential: Mr ranks 8th in wealth generation but is one of the top exported products. This implies that **opportunities may exist to improve its value through better market positioning or finding higher-value markets for its export.**\n",

    "**3. Yearly and Monthly Trade Fluctuations**\n",

    "- Leading Suppliers: Wright Group and Brown PLC have emerged as the top suppliers contributing the most to the total value of exported goods. **Strengthening relationships with these suppliers or exploring collaborations could provide competitive advantages in pricing, delivery speed, and product availability.**\n",
    "- Focus on Trade Balance: Countries like Bahrain have the largest trade balance gap, focusing more on exports. **We should explore opportunities in these regions for export-led growth or assess the demand for imported goods in the markets to address trade imbalances.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**5. Product Pricing and Transactional Insights**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Average Trade Value per Transaction: The average trade value per transaction is $5057.81, which serves as a benchmark for evaluating the efficiency and profitability of international transactions. Whether their transactions fall below or above this average must be analysed further to analyze the factors influencing transaction size and value.\n",
    "- Product Profitability: The product Need has the highest average value per product, indicating it could be a high-margin product for exporters . **Focusing on increasing the trade of such high-value products can help boost profitability.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**6. Payment Terms and Transaction Patterns**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Payment Terms: Cash on Delivery is preferred in countries like Bahrain, while Net 30 terms are common in India. Understanding regional payment preferences is essential for negotiating better payment terms and ensuring smoother transactions. **Customizing payment options based on country-specific preferences could improve cash flow management.**\n",
    "- Order Frequency: The similar time between orders for both imports and exports (approximately 1.85 days for exports and 1.80 days for imports) suggests that purchasing patterns for both types of trade are steady. **This regularity can help in forecasting demand, planning inventory, and managing production schedules more efficiently.**"

    "2. Optimize Supply Chain for Peak Periods: Plan logistics around seasonal spikes (like August) and ensure supply chain resilience during disruptive events such as pandemics.\n",

    "4. Reevaluate Pricing Strategies: Products like Now, which are exported in large volumes but do not generate top wealth, may require better pricing strategies or repositioning in higher-value markets.\n",
    "5. Enhance Payment Flexibility: Tailor payment terms to match the preferences of different countries to improve transaction efficiency and client satisfaction.\n",
